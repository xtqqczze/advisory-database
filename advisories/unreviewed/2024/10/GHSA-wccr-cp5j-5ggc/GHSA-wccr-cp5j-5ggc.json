  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nspi: hisi-kunpeng: Add verification for the max_frequency provided by the firmware\n\nIf the value of max_speed_hz is 0, it may cause a division by zero\nerror in hisi_calc_effective_speed().\nThe value of max_speed_hz is provided by firmware.\nFirmware is generally considered as a trusted domain. However, as\ndivision by zero errors can cause system failure, for defense measure,\nthe value of max_speed is validated here. So 0 is regarded as invalid\nand an error code is returned.",
